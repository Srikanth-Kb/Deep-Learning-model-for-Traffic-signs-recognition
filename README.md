# Deep-Learning-model-for-Traffic-signs-recognition
This represents a deep learning model using convolutional neural network architecture for classification of traffic signs. The model is trained on a custom dataset, prepared using augumentation techniques consists of 1000 images for each class-label. The performance of the training and validation dataset is also recorded.
